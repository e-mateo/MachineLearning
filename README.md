## Introduction :
---
 **Machine Learning** is a project made on Unity 3D, focused on implementing an Artificial Neural Network to train Artificial Intelligences in a video-game situation. <br>
 For this project, I choose to implement my neural network in a custom game that I made. <br>
 This project has been made by **ERBISTI Mat√©o**, programming student at Isart Digital Paris. <br>
 The project started on **December 1st** and finished on **January 2nd**. <br>



 ## Objectives :
 ---
 At first, my objective was to train AIs in a simple game like **Gravity Guy**, a 2D game where the player always runs forward and can choose to change the gravity to avoid obstacles. <br>
 So the objective was that the more AIs play, the better they become thanks to their **neural network**. <br>
 As I succeeded in this objective and that I had some time left, I wanted to make the game a little bit **more complex** and see if AIs could still be good at the game. <br>
 This is why I implemented a color feature in the game. Each AI and obstacle has one color: Red or Blue. AIs can go through obstacles of the same color as them without being killed. <br>
 But if they touch an obstacle of the other color, they are instantly killed. <br> I also made a random timer between 5 and 10 seconds to switch the color of every AI (The timer is displayed on the screen). <br>
 Adding this feature made the neural network more complex because it had more inputs to take into account. <br>  I wanted to try how AIs will behave with more inputs and if they can still learn well how to play the game. <br>

 ## How to test the project :
 ---

You can open the **TrainedGravityRun** scene to directly have a scene with a trained AI and with the training disabled. <br><br>
You can also open the **GravityRun** scene which is the training room for my AIs. <br>
When playing the game, there is a **Save AI button** at the top of the screen with an Input Field. <br> The input field allows you to specify a **file's path** to save the neural network (for example `AINetworks/NeuralNetwork.txt`). <br>
When pressing the Save AI button, it will save one of the remaining AIs so you can wait until there are a few AIs left to save the best ones. <br>
To load a neural network, click on an **AI game object**, and in the inspector go to the **GeneticMLPNetwork** component and **fill the path variable** with the path of your neural network file (for example `AINetworks/NeuralNetwork.txt`). <br>
It will then automatically load it when pressing the play button. <br><br>
The `AINetworks/NeuralNetwork.txt` already exists and is a trained version of the AI that I got. <br> You can try it directly to see what results I got. <be>

  ## How did I achieve this :
  ---

  First of all, before starting to make my game project, I created two types of **multi-layered neural networks**: one with **back-propagation** and the other with **genetic algorithms**.  <br>
  <br><br>
  - ### Back-propagation:
	For the neural network with the **back-propagation**, I mainly inspired myself from the `Artificial Intelligence for Games` book by Ian Millington to create my own network in C#. <br>
	The book was well explained and allowed me to have a basic neural network quickly which I then improved to have a **multi-layer** neural network with **multiple hidden layers**. I also add new **activation functions** such as the Tanh and ReLU functions. <br>
  After implementing my own network on Unity, I tested it with some basic cases such as an **XOR operator** and it worked well. <br>
<br><br>
  - ### Genetic Algorithms:
	For this one, I took back the network with the back-propagation and I updated it to make it with **genetic algorithms**. <br>
	Basically, I deleted the backpropagation to add **crossover and mutation** functions. <br>
	I choose to do a crossover with a **single cut point** by taking half of the neutrons of parent A by copying their input weights to the new offspring  and by taking the other half from parent B. <br>
	For the mutation, I added a **mutation rate** between 0 and 1 which will tell the mutation's frequency. <br> Then when a mutation happens, I simply add a little **random offset** between -0.2 and 0.2 to the input weight to modify it a little bit. <br>
	I also updated the trainer to make the **selection of the best AIs** with a **fitness function**, choose two parents for each crossover, and create the **new population**. <br>

  - ### The Game:
	- #### Which Neural Network did I choose?
	After testing those two networks, I had to choose which one I would use for my game and I decided to take the one with **genetic algorithms** for multiple reasons.<br>
	First of all, it doesn't need to have a training set or to know the expected output depending on each input to correct the weights which is really useful, especially in my type of game. <br>
	It will simply select the best AIs to create a new population that is supposed to be better than the previous one. <br>
	Also in my case, choosing the best AIs wasn't difficult, I simply needed to compare how much time they survived so it wasn't a problem for me. <br>
	When I was doing some tests I also saw that I had good results quicker with genetic algorithms than with the backpropagation. <br>
	Finally, I also wanted to personally test how genetic algorithms will behave in a video-game situation and if we can have good results with them. <br>

  ## Results :
  ---

  At first, I made the game without the color system so I didn't have a lot of inputs and I quickly had **great results** with one or more AIs being able to survive for a long time **in approximately 8-10 or fewer generations**. <br>
  Then I made **the color system** which gave me **more inputs** and this time it can take **a little bit longer to have good results** but AIs are also able to survive for a long time after some generations. <br>
  As I choose to use genetic algorithms, I always have some AIs that are quite good after a few generations and some others that are still really bad because of bad mutations or crossovers. <br>
  There are still **some areas that can be improved** such as the crossover and mutation functions that can be done in different ways and may give better results than I have. <br>
  For example for the crossover, I use the single-point crossover method. 
  It works well, but crossovers can be done in different ways with multiple split points, which may work better. <br>
  The number of hidden layers and neutrons can also not be the best choice (same things for activation functions). <br>
  The choice of every input is also something that will have a big impact on the results and this can be an area to improve. <br>
